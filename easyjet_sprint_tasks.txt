[ ] Split current http server into management and mock servers.
    [ ] Move mocking logic to mock server, and simplify in boss server
    [ ] Mock http server should talk to management server to retrieve responses for
        requests, and store history.
    [ ] Convert all communication to JSON instead of tricky HTTP headers
[ ] From management server, spin up mock http server on request.
[ ] Management server gives the client a unique id (UID) which should be included in
    the url given to it for use against the mock server.
[ ] Refactor storage in the management server to store by UID
[ ] Refactor history storage and retrieval to be less dependent on HTTP calls.
[ ] Return JSON that the client knows what to do with.
